Things to try when it's all going wrong

- work backwards - commenting out code (w/routes)
- console log --> see what you're getting & that you got there
- check your assumptions, verify the types of things you're getting
- try the order of the code
- verify the database setup & type the query manually in terminal
- walk the path yourself
- rebuild simply
- google
- don't just code for the errors
- work back to truth and then move forward
- ask for help.. don't drown forever
- move on to something else if you can and build that, come back to the issue
- to see what changes you've made in your repo: git diff
- cmd + shift + f in atom will search whole project
- see if there are multiple node servers running - and kill them
  * to find unkilled prcocesses:  ps aux | grep node
  * to kill a process: kill -9 PID (where PID is the process id)
  * psql [mydatabase_name] -c â€˜SELECT * FROM [table_name];
- the bug does not mean you suck (you suck because you suck, the bug is just a code thing).. jk - you don't suck
