Things to try when it's all going wrong

- work backwards - commenting out code (w/routes)
- console log --> see what you're getting & that you got there
- check your assumptions, verify the types of things you're getting
- try the order of the code
- verify the database setup & type the query manually in terminal
- walk the path yourself
- rebuild simply
- google
- don't just code for the errors
- work back to truth and then move forward


- ask for help.. don't drown forever
- move on to something else if you can and build that, come back to the issue
- the bug does not mean you suck (you suck because you suck, the bug is just a code thing).. jk - you don't suck
